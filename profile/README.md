## Markdown Magic
Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of Markdown. Here are a few tips to enhance your Markdown skills:

- **Headings**: Use `#` for headings. The number of `#` symbols denotes the level of the heading.
- **Lists**: Use `-`, `*`, or `+` for unordered lists, and numbers for ordered lists.
- **Links**: Create links using `[link text](url)`.
- **Images**: Embed images using `![alt text](url)`.
- **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code blocks and single backticks (\`) for inline code.

Example:
```markdown
# This is a Heading

- This is a list item
- Another list item
